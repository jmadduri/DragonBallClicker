# DragonBallClicker
This app is a twist on the Cookie Clicker game. It has similar functions except it is a Dragon Ball theme. The user can click on the Dragon Ball in the center of the screen until they reach a certain number. When they reach this number, a Goku will pop up and will give them passive Dragon Balls without them needing to click. As the user attains more Goku's, they are able to get more and more passive Dragon Balls.
